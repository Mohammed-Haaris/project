- **Mathematics Basics**: Linear algebra, statistics, calculus
- **Python Programming**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Data Understanding**: Types of data, data quality, exploratory data analysis

### 2. Core ML Concepts (Week 3-4)
- **Supervised Learning**: Classification and Regression
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, cross-validation

### 3. Algorithms Deep Dive (Week 5-8)
- **Linear Models**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- **Tree-based Models**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Support Vector Machines**
- **Neural Networks**: Basic concepts and implementation

### 4. Practical Projects (Week 9-12)
- **Project 1**: House Price Prediction
- **Project 2**: Customer Churn Prediction
